# CSM61ASp23
In the Spring 2023 semester, I served as an associate mentor for Computer Science Mentors at Berkeley for CS61A. CS61A is one of the introductory CS courses
at UC Berkeley. It goes over the strucutre and interpretation of computer programs primarily in Python. The course also provides an introduction to basic
data structures such as arrays, linked lists, trees etc. As a mentor, I hold weekly sections to reinforce concepts covered that week in lecture. 
Typical lecture sections usually consist of me providing a quick mini lecture followed by a worksheet. I do not create the worksheets, they are created by
the CSM content team. This repository contains the materials I create for my sections.
